            <p class="text"> 
            From a very young age I've been very passionate about coding and all things tech.
            <br>
            <b>NOT</b> 
            <br>
            Could've very well started on the intoduction that way but I'd obviously be lying.
            <br>
            Although for one I do have a love for coding 
            <br>
            but I'm a cbse student that has really zero experience 
            in it.
            <br>
            But I'm pretty much determined to learn all this up.
            <br>
            Right now,I'm a first year at Model Engineering college,pursuing CU or
            <br>
             Computer Science and Business Systems
            as it is known.
            <br>
            There's nothing I dont like to explore and hence Ive been trying to
            <br>
             engage myself in different hobbies and such.
            <br>
            If you're looking for a fellow book enthusiast to chat about the latest cliff-hanger or
            <br> geek out over the classics,
            you've come to the right place! 
            <br>
            Oh! also I can't function without coffee.
            <br>
            And if you reached down here,thank you and I hope you have a great day ahead!
            <br>
